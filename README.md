# Wildlife-Conservation-in-C-te-d-Ivoire
This project is part of my AI certification at WorldQuant University. It focuses on leveraging deep learning and computer vision to aid wildlife conservation efforts in CÃ´te d'Ivoire. The goal is to classify images from camera traps to identify the presence of specific animal species or determine if no animal is present.
